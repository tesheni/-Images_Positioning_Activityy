  <p>Let Your Web Site Do Your Work <br>
You want to run a business out of your home or a storefront, but you need a sales and marketing plan. The Web can be your most 
effective, tireless 24x7 salesperson. <br> Here are some tips to turn your Web site into an effective marketing tool: 
</p>

<div class="text-box"> <!-- This is div 1 -->
        <h1>LOOKS MATTER</h1>
        <p>If your site looks amateurish, you'll lose credibility with your customers. Avoid using blinking, flashing, scrolling, and 
crawling text. You're running a business 
Web site, not a carnival. Choose a 
readable font in a size that's easy to read. 
Stick to one font face and not more than 
three font sizes. It may be interesting to 
have 10 different font faces on your site, but having too many font faces tends to detract from your site, not enhance it. 
Your Web site should not look like a 
ransom note. Use neutral tones or colors 
that complement each other. Avoid red and green color combinations - 5% of 
the population is color blind and may have 
trouble reading such text. Red is also 
associated with danger and financial loss. </p>
    </div>
  
  
<div class="text-box"> <!-- This is div 2 -->
        <h1>Tile Tales</h1>

  <p>No, I'm not talking about titles such as Ms. or Mrs. and the like. Search engines scan the title bar in their search for "hits." If your company name is "Astro Galaxy Unlimited" and you sell cosmetics, you might do a great job in attracting 
astrophysicists to your Web site, but you're not going to land at the top of anyone's 
hit list who's searching for cosmetics. Include meaningful words in the title, not just 
the company name. 
</p>

  <div class="entertain"> <!-- This is div 1 -->
        <h1>Let Your Page Inform, not Entertain</h1>
        <p>Flash is a technology that places interesting animations on a Web page. Don't let 
your site have a Flash "splash page," whereby the visitor to your site has to click to 
first get past the Flash page in order to view your home page. Put the Flash 
presentations on your home page so that the user has a choice of whether or not to view the Flash presentation.  </p>
