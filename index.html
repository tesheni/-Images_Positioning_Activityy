  <p>Let Your Web Site Do Your Work <br>
You want to run a business out of your home or a storefront, but you need a sales and marketing plan. The Web can be your most 
effective, tireless 24x7 salesperson. Here are some tips to turn your Web site into an effective marketing tool: 
</p>


  <h2>LOOKS MATTER</h2>
  <br>
  <p>If your site looks amateurish, you'll lose credibility with your customers. Avoid using blinking, flashing, scrolling, and 
crawling text. You're running a business 
Web site, not a carnival. Choose a 
readable font in a size that's easy to read. 
Stick to one font face and not more than 
three font sizes. It may be interesting to 
have 10 different font faces on your site, but having too many font faces tends to detract from your site, not enhance it. 
Your Web site should not look like a 
ransom note. Use neutral tones or colors 
that complement each other. Avoid red and green color combinations - 5% of 
the population is color blind and may have 
trouble reading such text. Red is also 
associated with danger and financial loss.
